Kernal:

“Kernel” is used due to a set of mathematical functions used in Support Vector Machine providing the window to manipulate the data. So, Kernel Function generally transforms the training set of data so that a non-linear decision surface is able to transform to a linear equation in a higher number of dimension spaces.

Different Types of kernal functions:
            1. Polynomial Kernal
            2. RBF Kernal
            3. Sigmoid Kernal

Polynomial Kernal:
It represents the similarity of vectors in the training set of data in a feature space over polynomials of the original variables used in the kernel.

Sigmoid Kernal:
this function is equivalent to a two-layer, perceptron model of the neural network, which is used as an activation function for artificial neurons.

RBF Kernal:
Improvement of Gaussian Kernal.
